# ARMv6 processor

Design and implementation of a processor in Verilog HDL based on ARMv6 architecture, and a compiler in C++ for this processor. The design consisted of the combinational execution paths (CLA adder, 3-bit Booth Multiplication, Barrel Shifter and division without overflow), a Load/Store path, a forwarding and a static branch prediction unit.
